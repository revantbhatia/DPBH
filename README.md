# Car Price Prediction Model

## Overview
This project implements a car price prediction model using linear regression. The model predicts car prices based on several parameters including:
- Year
- Selling_Price
- Present_Price
- Kms_Driven
- Fuel_Type
- Seller_Type
- Transmission
- Owner

## Model Technique
Linear regression is utilized as the predictive technique in this project. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (car prices). The model learns the coefficients for each feature to predict car prices.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
